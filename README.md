# blockchain-fraud-analysis-case-001
This case study explores the forensic tracing of a suspicious on-chain transaction on Ethereum involving a $24,000+ USDT transfer. Leveraging tools like Etherscan, the transaction path, wallet behaviour, and potential risk indicators were analysed.

## Red Flags:
- Sudden high-value transfer from an address with no prior outgoing activity.
- Use of common token hopping pattern (ETH ‚Üí USDT).
- No smart contract interaction other than direct transfer.
- Possible early-stage layering (potential laundering).

## Analyst Note:
This repo is part of a broader initiative to highlight behavioral patterns in blockchain fraud for the purpose of improving forensic practices and platform security.

Typically in crypto fraud, cold wallets are used for the extraction and short-term holding of stolen funds. These wallets are often ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù for a few weeks or months in advance to avoid triggering anti-fraud signals. Fraudsters intentionally keep them dormant until ready, minimizing detection risks while executing high-value transfers.

We will now trace the blockchain activity of the most recent transfer for any further cold wallet signs
